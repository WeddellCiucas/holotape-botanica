VENUS FLYTRAP
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ Or Dionaea muscipula, it's a carnivorous plant native to coastal bogs and sandhills. It's known for its fast-closing leaf traps that snap shut when the trigger hairs are touched twice by unsuspecting insects.
⸙ The insects get trapped and they get dissolved so the plant can extract nutrients; a feature especially useful as it's an adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor soils.
⸙ While its habitat has drastically declined before the War due to pollution and its popularity as a household plant option, the past two hundred years after the war has given it enough time to slowly recover and even thrive in radioactive conditions.
⸙ Some pre-war research highlights that the plant may produce antioxidants and other compounds with anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic properties, but these have yet to be experimented and proven.
