⸙ It's a tall tree with smooth white bark and dark markings. It has round leaves and prefers cooler, more elevated terrain, such as the higher cliffs found in Utah and Colorado.
⸙ Bark tea contains salicylates, reducing pain and fever. Locals have also used it to soothe stomach cramps and other gastrointestinal problems.
⸙ It's not advised to take in high dosages, as salicin overdoses can induce nausea and dizziness. 
⸙ Topically, it's slightly antimicrobial. It helps with pain relief and cleaning minor wounds.
⸙ The high in cellulose inner bark can be scraped and dried to make emergency flour or porridge. The taste is pretty bland, but it's certainly better than any wasteland irradiated food you could come across.
