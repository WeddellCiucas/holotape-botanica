──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ The cattail is included in a genus of 30 different species, varying of tall, perennial, aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. 
⸙ They have long, slender leaves and distinctive brown, cylinder-shaped seed spikes.
⸙ They are dominant in wetlands and thrive in shallow water and marshes. 
⸙ Can be found in both temperate and tropical zones.
⸙ The rhizomes are edible when cooked and peeled. The rootstocks are starchy and can be ground into flour or eaten like tubers.
⸙ The buds, young shoots, leaf bases and young flower spikes are edible raw and cooked.
⸙ Pollen can also be used as flour or seasoning.
⸙ The rhizome flour has strong anti-inflammatory effects when used to help and prevent colon damage and other digestive potential issues.
⸙ The cattail is also used in weaving for mats, baskets, insulation, and can even be used to craft paper.
⸙ The down can be used as a life vest filler, bird nesting material, and tinder for fire. It also absorbs pollutants and heavy metals from water.
