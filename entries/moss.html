MOSS
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's a non-vascular, spore-producing plant that grows in soft, green carpets or clumps on rocks, trees and soil. It grows in moist and shady areas. 
⸙ It helps regulate water absorption and soil stability in ecosystems.
⸙ Some types of moss were used in Old Wars to be collected and used as surgical bandages as they can absorb 20x its weights in fluids and can inhibit bacterial growth.
⸙ Thus are more effective than cotton dressings.
⸙ However, they can retain and absorb radiation at much higher concentration.
