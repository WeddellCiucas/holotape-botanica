PRICKLY PEAR
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It grows thick green pads covered in spines, and blooms bright yellow and red flowers. 
⸙ The fruit is bulbous, reddish-purple. 
⸙ It prefers arid, semi-desertic climate, in sandy soil. 
⸙ The fruit is used in poultices for swelling or bruises. 
⸙ High in fiber and vitamin C. 
⸙ The pad interior can be used like aloe vera for minor cuts and burns. 
⸙ The raw mucilage, or the uncooked pad can cause nausea or a laxative effect. 
⸙ The fruit is covered in extremely fine but sharp hairs that can irritate the skin. I personally advise leather gloves when picking and skinning the fruit. Those hairs are so thin you can barely see them, but each hand movement becomes painful.
