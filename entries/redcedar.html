RED CEDAR TREE
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ In the same family as the cypress  
⸙ It's actually a juniper tree, not to be confused with actual cedar trees  
⸙ It can grow up to 20-50 feet tall
⸙ Dense, conical, evergreen trees, the needles are scale-like, the bark is reddish, and they seem to produce small blue berries.  
⸙ They tend to favor dry, open highland climates and grow in rocky soil  
⸙ The wood seems to repel insects, so it can be used in anti-Cazador salves or other bug balms.  
⸙ The resin is used by local tribes to waterproof their tools and gear.  
⸙ The charcoal is added to salves and poultices due to its antibacterial properties.  
⸙ The berries are toxic, can cause cramps and hallucinations, they especially damage the liver.
