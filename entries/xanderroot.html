XANDER ROOT
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's a rare root with healing properties growing in the western United States.
⸙ Its healing effects are powerful, as it can be brewed into a strong cure when mixed together with the Broc Flower as a base, even better than a stimpak as it has none of its chemical drawbacks.
⸙ It's a vital plant praised by survivalists, nomads and the fishermen worshipping the Goddess of the Sea, in the communities on the Pacific Coast.
⸙ It's often commonly found on trails, rocks, and around the mouths of caves, but also in the open deserts.
⸙ It's easily visible due to its tall green stalk that protrudes out of the sand and shallow rock outcrops. Its thick, three-pronged root can also be partially seen from the ground.
⸙ The root itself vaguely resembles a turnip.
