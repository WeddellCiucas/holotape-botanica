PUNGA PLANT
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ The punga plant grows all over Point Lookout in Maryland.
⸙ Uniquely from any other plant encountered, it has the ability to scrub the radiation from the system, while also healing the rest of the damage caused by it and other ailments. It's a miracle plant.
⸙ The wild version of the fruit is covered in rough brown skin, and was discovered to emit electrical discharge similar to citrus fruits and potatoes.
⸙ A refined cousin of its wild variant bears fruits that are smooth, yellow-green.
