HUB FLOWER

⸙ Also known as Ranunculacae Serranus.
⸙ It grows in sizable bushes with large, hanging, bitter-tasting purple flowers with restorative effects. 
⸙ Before the war, this genus of plants also included the buttercup flowers.
⸙ The flowers grow in layered petal clusters, and seem to have adapted to high rad soil. 
⸙ Wastelanders steep or brew it into teas, or use it in detoxing salves and poultices.
⸙ If they absorbed too many rads from the contaminated soil, they'll bear a distinguishing orange-yellow color.
