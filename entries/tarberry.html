──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ The tarberry is a plant similar to the cranberry, as it's cultivated in wetlands and bogs. 
⸙ The fruits are small, dusty orange and water-grown.
⸙ They have mild cleansing properties as they can be brewed into a detoxing salve.
⸙ Besides that, like cranberries, they can be used in various sweet dishes, juices, or brewed into a wine.
