THISTLE
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ Usually found near forest edges or hills, along unkept and not very populated paths.  
⸙ It's a spiny-stemmed plant with purple flowers. 
⸙ Easily distinguishable by their narrow, jagged leaves.  
⸙ They grow about 1-3 ft. tall, either by themselves or in clumps.  
⸙ It prefers cool to temperate climates, poor and rocky soil, and doesn't require much moisture.  
⸙ It seems to resemble the Old World milk thistle, as such it has retained some properties that aid with liver detoxification.  
⸙ In poultices, it has anti-inflammatory properties, can ease swelling and soreness, and has been used to apply to rashes and burns.  
⸙ Beware over-consumption, to avoid nausea.  
⸙ Only harvest from relatively safe and clean areas, as this plant may absorb spores or heavy metals like lead. 
⸙ Learned it on my skin.
