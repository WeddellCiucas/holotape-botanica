CUCUMBER
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's a rapid-growing creeping vine, producing cylindrical to spherical fruits. 
⸙ It thrives in warm-season environments and prefers a full sun and well-drained soil. 
⸙ The fruits, being composed out of approximately 95-96% water, make a wonderful hydration source.
⸙ Unfortunately, they're mostly grown in hydroponic labs in functional Vaults.
⸙ They are rich sources of vitamins and skin-supportive silica.
⸙ Topical application of the fruit can aid in soothing skin irritation, sunburn and inflammation.
