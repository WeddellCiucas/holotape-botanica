CYPRESS
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ Tall, evergreen trees native to the state of Utah and other southwestern U.S. regions.
⸙ I have identified it via Old World botanical books to be the Arizona cypress, or Cupressus arizonica. 
⸙ They are conical in shape, with scale-like leaves, and the bark is grayish. 
⸙ They are well adapted to arid climate, and can survive with little water. 
⸙ Non-hostile locals have revealed that cypress resin is used to treat wounds and create salves to take on trips. Further study revealed the resin to contain antimicrobial agents. 
⸙ Crushed leaves used in teas help with lung and sinus relief, while whipped into a salve reduces swelling and muscle pain via topical application. 
⸙ The bark is rich in tannin, also used in teas, but also used to tan the hides for their leather apparel, tents, and other purposes. 
⸙ Local tribes smoke the branches and leaves in a purification ritual, as explained by the residing missionary informing me of their customs. 
⸙ Consuming in high doses or improperly brewed, cypress oil can do more harm than good, causing rashes and irritations. (-10 poison damage).
⸙ Never burn green bark.
