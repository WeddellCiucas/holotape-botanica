CORN

⸙ Also known as Maize by the denizens of New Vegas and the west coast, it's a tall, annual grass. 
⸙ It can reach up to 10 feet tall, and grows long, narrow green leaves. 
⸙ The product, called an 'ear', is wrapped in husks and edible kernels.  
⸙ It grows in warm and temperate climates, and prefers rich and loamy soils. 
⸙ Its high carbohydrate content provides a great energy source and nutritional value.  
⸙ Can produse vegetable starch with multiple uses, even some sort of adhesive.  
⸙ It can be distilled into alcohol.  
⸙ As a cute side note, I have watched the children of one of the villages I came across, brush the tassels on top of the ear corn to make some sort of makeshift 'dolls'.
