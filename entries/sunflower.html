SUNFLOWER
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's an annual flowering plant, easily recognizable by its towering stem and large, bright yellow flower head.   
⸙ The flower is also composed of a ray and the disk florets.
⸙ They thrive in full sun, across temperate regions.
⸙ It's notable to mention that they are always facing the sun, and even better; if there's no sun in sight, they'll face each other.
⸙ They are often used in crop rotation and habitat restoration, even for phytoremediation of heavy metals and radionuclides.
⸙ The seeds are rich in protein and healthy fats, dietary fibers and vitamins.
⸙ Oil can also be extracted from the sunflower seeds and used for cooking.
⸙ The soluble fibers support gut health and lower disease risks.
