MUTFRUIT
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ Also known as Malus maatta, is a species of mutated apples and crabapples. 
⸙ This particular strain, to my knowledge, is exclusive to the post-war North American continent, until further discoveries are made by my colleagues. 
⸙ They can be eaten by humans and ghouls alike, and depending on their location, they can carry irradiated isotopes. 
⸙ The trees are short, with grayish bark with roots that are shallow enough to grow and thrive in contained man-made pots.
⸙ The foliage is yellow and the skin of the fruit is deep purple.
⸙ The fruit is sweet, occasionally crunchy, and versatile in wasteland-born recipes and dishes.
⸙ There's a green variant found in New California.
⸙ Mutfruits in general are nutritious even if eaten raw, but can also be used in sweets recipes or brewed into alcohol due to their high sugar content. 
⸙ Research notes indicate that the sugar compounds stimulate platelet production to close wounds. This suggests the presence of restorative properties if properly extracted and administered.
