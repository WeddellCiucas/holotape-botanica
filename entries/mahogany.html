MAHOGANY TREE
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's a wide genus of trees found worldwide, prized for their straight grain, rich reddish-brown hue wood and durability. Or at least they have been prized before the war.
⸙ They were used in high-end furniture and wooden structures, musical instruments and even shipbuilding. 
⸙ The leaves are large, around 17 inches long. The leaflets are even in number and are connected by a central midrib.
⸙ The fruits are often called "sky fruits" as they grow upwards towards the sky. 
⸙ The ethyl acetate fraction from the seeds were studied for anti-inflammatory properties, claiming to improve blood circulation and skin condition.
⸙ However, there were also reports of liver injury or toxicity after consuming the raw seeds. 
⸙ Old folk medicine recommended ingesting no more than one seed per day.
