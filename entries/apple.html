APPLE
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ Medium-sized tree with grayish bark, round green leaves. Blooming flowers are pink-to-white before fruiting. 
⸙ Fruit is round, red-skinned. Strangely enough, the Mojave Wasteland seems to hold the secret to juicy, fresh apples, as they did not seem to change much over the course of the past two irradiated centuries.
⸙ Requires a temperate climate, well-drained soil, and constant irrigation. They don't seem to grow in the wild wasteland terrain, only in controlled and protected environments. 
⸙ Vault-level preservation (?)
⸙ Fruit is sweet, juicy, and highly nutritive. 
⸙ Natural antioxidant, rich in vitamin C, high in fibers and aids in digestion, improves the immune system and helps clear out chems side effects. 
⸙ Juicy enough to provide mild hydration.
