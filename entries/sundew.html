SUNDEW
──────────────────────────── </center>

⸙ It's a small, carnivorous herb that forms rosettes, using sticky glandular tentacles to trap insects. However, like most post-war fauna and flora, their size rapidly increased. They can be now considered to be small trees - hazard.
⸙ Many species rely partly on prey nutrition.
⸙ They are widely distributed in bogs and wet meadows.
⸙ Apparently, they have been historically used since the 12th century to treat coughs, bronchitis and asthma, due to its antispasmodic, antitussive and expectorant properties.
⸙ Modern pre-war research shows that sundew extracts can show potential for airway cell regeneration, suggesting that it could benefit in combating pollution-related respiratory issues.
