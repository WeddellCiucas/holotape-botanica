FIRECRACKER BERRY
──────────────────────────── </center>
	
⸙ The firecracker berries are vibrant and red that glow in the dark and the leaves are bright orange.
⸙ If trampled, they'll start to rattle before exploding.
⸙ Despite their volatile nature, they can be consumed raw or can be cooked in various dishes.
⸙ Can also be distilled into whiskey, steeped into tea, or brewed into healing salves, hinting at their regenerative properties.
