𓍊𓋼 Also known as the Cave Fungus. 
𓍊𓋼 Its latin name is Flammulina velutipes, and part of the landscape of the post-War wasteland.
𓍊𓋼 They can be found throughout the Wasteland, but especially inside and around cave walls, in rock outcrops and clusters.
𓍊𓋼 They also exhibit faint luminescence and can be eaten raw, but they provide a medium dose of radiation so it's best if they're cooked beforehand.
