PATCH NOTES
──────────────────────────── </center>

Dear User, 

As this research project is unable to be wrapped up in one sweep of the wasteland, it will be dynamically updated as sources get verified, interviews get covered, and research gets conducted. You can check here the new entries that have been added to the botanical archive.


PATCH - v1.1
• Blueberries - can be grown in vaults and hydroponic labs, as many other pre-war crops.
• 

INITIAL VERSION - v1.0
• All the original plants found in the first sweep.
